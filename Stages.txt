Stage 1: In this video only stage 1 will be done.

I will be creating a nodejs application to collect feedback form from customers.

*1. Initialize a npm application to creaje package.json file.
*2. Install npm packages that are required and it should reflect in package.json file.
*3. create index.js file to create the API.
*4. import all the packages and create methods in index.js for new entry and search entry and one method to display on which port the api is running.
*5. seperate http template file in views folder and routes folder
*6. after developing the Api, check it using localhost:3000
*7. if everything is OK, upload to github repository, so it can be acccessed anywhere.

Stage 1 is completed at present.

Stage 2:
In this video, i will be completing the following steps and finishing this project at full.
to launch an EC2 instance i will be logging in my aws account. and proceeding from there.
I am connecting through AWS  conenct option. if this does not work, any remote client application can be used.
after creation i am preparing my server for further steps.
till its getting update, i am going to write couchdb container command:
to pull the container image: docker pull couchdb
to run the container: docker run -d -p 5984:5984 -e COUCHDB_USER=admin -e COUCHDB_PASSWORD=password --name my-couchdb couchdb

incase of aws server, my localhost will be changed to server public ip address.
anyone with the link for that api can connect to it

Launching my application using AWS EC2 Linux instance and accessing my data using couchDB API.

*1. create an EC2 Linux instance and deploy it with required configurations.
*2. add a security setting to allow incoming traffic to that server.
*3. update all the packages on the system and download docker,npm,node,git packages if required.
*4. download the couchdb container from docker hub and run it using docker engine.
*5. once the container is deployed, check it using localhost:5984/_utils and create a feedback database after logging in.
*6. git clone the feedback form from github repository and deploy the application
*7. distribute the link and check it using any other system so that we can collect the feedback.
*8. check if data is coming or not using couchdb Web api.
9. If all steps are performed, terminate the EC2 instance.

Since everything looks O.k. and everything is done in this project.I am going to terminate my EC2 instance.

Stage 2 is also completed.
Thank You.
